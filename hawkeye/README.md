HawkEye is a simple tool to crawl the filesystem or a directory looking for interesting stuff like SSH Keys, Log Files, Sqlite Database, password files, etc. Hawkeye uses a fast filesystem crawler to look through files recursively and then sends them for analysis in real time and presents the data in both json format and simple console output. The tool is built with a modular approach making it easy to use and easily extensible. 

It can be used during pentests as a privilege escalation tool to look through the filesystem finding configuration files or ssh keys sometimes left by the sys-admins.

```

You can use `-v` flag to show verbose output. You can also get json output using `-o` flag.
```javascript
[
    {
        "path": "/home/ice3man/oldvps/root/.bash_history",
        "description": "Shell command history file",
        "comment": ""
    },
    {
        "path": "/home/ice3man/oldvps/root/.profile",
        "description": "Shell profile configuration file",
        "comment": "Shell configuration files can contain passwords, API keys, hostnames and other goodies"
    },
    {
        "path": "/home/ice3man/oldvps/root/.bashrc",
        "description": "Shell configuration file",
        "comment": "Shell configuration files can contain passwords, API keys, hostnames and other goodies"
    },
]
```

You can list the signatures present in the tool's database by using `-l` option.
```bash
[-] Signatures present in Database:
	-> CryptoFiles
	-> PasswordFiles
	-> ConfigurationFiles
	-> DatabaseFiles
	-> MiscFiles
```

You can specify the signatures to be used by the tool by passing the `--sig` flag. It takes a comma-separated list of signatures to be used. You can also specify exclusion of certain signatures using `--exclude-sig` flag.
```bash
ice3man@TheDaemon î‚° ~/tmp î‚° ./hawkeye -d /home/ice3man -sig cryptofiles
ice3man@TheDaemon î‚° ~/tmp î‚° ./hawkeye -d /home/ice3man -exclude-sig miscfiles
```
